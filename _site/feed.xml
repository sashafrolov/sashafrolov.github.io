        <title>2 New Applications of zk-SNARKs (Free Ideas!)</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-free-ideas-i-dont-have-the-time-to-execute-on&quot;&gt;2 free ideas I don’t have the time to execute on&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://soatok.blog/2024/12/09/ideas-and-execution/&quot;&gt;a similar blog post by Soatok&lt;/a&gt;. This semester at grad school, I had a couple of ideas for real-world applications where zk-SNARKs would be useful, but I didn’t have the time to write code or implement them. I particularly think that idea 1 would be a fun startup/at least an Ethereum hackathon idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea-1-zk-quantitative-strategies-for-stock-trading&quot;&gt;Idea 1: zk Quantitative Strategies for Stock Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is inspired by an issue of Matt Levine’s Money Stuff. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/56933&quot;&gt;the story about Jane Street vs Millennium here&lt;/a&gt;. To summarize the story, there is an ongoing lawsuit between two large quantitative hedge funds. Jane Street is suing Millennium because they believe that some people Millennium poached from Jane Street stole some sort of simple but counterintuitive and lucrative quantitative trading strategy and started using it at Millennium. The evidence has to do with patterns in the market changing and Jane Street’s profits being affected. Quantitative strategies are simple mechanical rules for how to trade stocks. They can range anywhere from simple rules like “buy $NVDA when it has gone down 15% in the last day” to complicated ML models that use a lot of data. They can be worth billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent direction of work in zero-knowledge proofs is “exploit sharing”, where you provide a proof that you know an input to a program that results in an exploit (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1223&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;). An example scenario where this would be useful is where you are trying to responsibly disclose the fact that you have found an exploit in a major piece of software. You could post a zk-SNARK proving that running the program on a secret input produces exploit-like behavior. Alternatively, you could use this to sell zero-day bugs in a way that requires less trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is an interesting combination of these two ideas in “Zero-Knowledge Quantitative Strategy Sharing”. Here, a person trying to sell a quantitative strategy (like an ex-Jane Street person), would provide a zero-knowledge proof that their strategy performs well on past data. Furthermore, they could provide a commitment to their strategy, and then provide a zero-knowledge proof a month later that the strategy performed well on the market in that time. This could decrease the level of trust required in these kinds of financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go further with this idea. You could have an anonymous, trustless hedge fund, where anonymous quants prove that they know effective quantitative strategies before they sell them to you. Even further, the hedge fund could not even be required to know the strategies it is trading on. The strategy owner could just send proofs that the strategy they committed to produced a certain sequence of trades, on which the hedge fund will then trade. In this system, anonymous analysts could get access to capital, just by proving that they know effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would probably improve market liquidity/efficiency by having fewer hedge funds have a monopoly over certain trades/strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea-2-hsts-header-database-for-tor-with-zk-snarks&quot;&gt;Idea 2: HSTS Header Database for Tor with zk-SNARKs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this idea, please look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://petsymposium.org/popets/2024/popets-2024-0020.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper from PETS 2024&lt;/a&gt; called “CoStricTor: Collaborative HTTP Strict Transport Security in Tor Browser”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To briefly explain the aforementioned paper, HSTS is a feature of HTTPS that lets a website say “this website will use HTTPS from now on” (rather than HTTP), which prevents downgrade attacks to HTTP. It is a security improvement most of the time. However, HSTS headers are stored in a client’s state (they are often called “supercookies” because they are part of a client’s state at a different level), and this means that a malicious actor can fingerprint clients by sending different HSTS headers for different websites. You can read more about this idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/browsing-in-privacy-mode-super-cookies-can-track-you-anyway/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this privacy issue, the Tor browser has yet to implement HSTS, even though it would be a security upgrade in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack is not possible if clients can compare the HSTS headers they receive from different websites to make sure that a website owner isn’t using HSTS to fingerprint users. The paper I linked builds a system that runs such a database as part of the Tor network. They focus on building this distributed database in a privacy-preserving way. This includes using differential privacy and other techniques. Their system scales fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major issue with this system, which is that malicious users can add garbage to the distributed HSTS header database. This system does not validate the reported headers at all (and the differentially private nature of the database obscures exactly how/what bad data was submitted). There is a potential application of zk-SNARKs here! At a high level, when a user adds an HSTS header to the database, they provide a zero-knowledge proof showing that they actually received the HSTS header they are reporting as part of an HTTP connection with the website. This allows the system to authenticate the reports it receives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, this protocol doesn’t work. The issue is that you normally can’t use zk-SNARKs directly to build a TLS oracle/zkTLS setup. You normally need trusted hardware or MPC to check that a piece of data actually came from a TLS connection with some party. The Tor setting offers an easy fix. Your Tor traffic necessarily goes through an exit node before going to its destination. The exit node your Tor traffic goes through sees your TLS traffic with the website you are communicating with. The user can attach a zero-knowledge proof that the TLS traffic that the exit node sees decrypts to a stream containing a given HSTS header. This gives you a TLS oracle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the exit node could verify the zero-knowledge proof, and submit it to the shared database. You now have the CoStricTor system with data validation (after working out some details). This is a decent bit of engineering, but I think it would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this interesting. I am giving these ideas away for free, but if you do use the idea, please mention me somewhere/tell me about it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Shenandoah National Park Itinerary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the summer (in June) I visited Shenandoah National Park with my family. We were staying at a hotel in Charlottesville, VA. I think I did a good job with planning our itinerary, and I thought the other itineraries I found online were not very good, so I am posting mine on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a map of the itinerary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of loop around Shenandoah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Fairfield+Inn+%26+Suites+Charlottesville+Downtown%2FUniversity+Area/Shenandoah+Nat&apos;l+Park+Sign/Stony+Man+Trailhead,+Appalachian+National+Scenic+Trail,+Luray,+VA/Pollock+Dining+Room+at+Skyland,+Skyland+Upper+Loop,+Luray,+VA/Hawksbill+Loop+Trailhead+Parking,+Luray,+VA/Blue+Ridge+Tunnel+Trail,+West+Trailhead/Fairfield+Inn+%26+Suites+Charlottesville+Downtown%2FUniversity+Area,+Cherry+Avenue,+Charlottesville,+VA/@38.3049581,-78.7507846,10.22z/data=!4m49!4m48!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b3863d04337505:0xb28f5333bd9c2979!2m2!1d-78.4892926!2d38.0263713!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b466becf263bdd:0xd522a8da2d44ede1!2m2!1d-78.5485021!2d38.3596086!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b44905bfdb6a87:0xe4f5bfd029ac5988!2m2!1d-78.3755453!2d38.5931805!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b44de27631937f:0x20c58fe4acc7f01f!2m2!1d-78.3803642!2d38.593022!1m10!1m1!1s0x89b445e0593a70cf:0xa0d9709afecc46f!2m2!1d-78.3868242!2d38.5561482!3m4!1m2!1d-78.721644!2d38.2341077!3s0x89b48659a81520b5:0xed31bdaf6292a0b9!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b36329e03f20f3:0xd053e82a614ca0bb!2m2!1d-78.8575955!2d38.0435911!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b3863d04337505:0xb28f5333bd9c2979!2m2!1d-78.4892926!2d38.0263713!3e0!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu&amp;amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;Here is the Google Maps link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Maps says it is 3 hours and 44 minutes, but don’t be scared, you can likely go a bit faster (wink, wink), and most of the driving time is on Skyline Drive, the road that runs the length of Shenandoah National Park. The road itself is a famous attraction at the park, so the driving is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned my itinerary around my family, who are in decent shape. They like hiking, but need some motivation like a view or something cool to look at to make it worthwhile. They also like somewhat frequent breaks from driving. In addition to the big stops, we briefly stopped at a few random overlooks along Skyline Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rundown of the itinerary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-enter-through-swift-run-gap-station&quot;&gt;1. Enter through Swift Run Gap Station&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Charlottesville, this is the closest park entrance. If you like taking photos with National Park signs, this is the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-hike-stony-man-mountain&quot;&gt;2. Hike Stony Man Mountain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/stony-man-via-appalachian-trail&quot;&gt;1.5 miles of distance/320 feet of elevation&lt;/a&gt;. This mountain has a cool view, and the hike from the parking lot overlaps with the Appalachian Trail, so you get to see Appalachian Trail through-hikers here, another cool sight at the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-get-blackberry-pie-at-pollock-dining-room&quot;&gt;3. Get Blackberry Pie at Pollock Dining Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Stony Man Mountain because you can walk to the Pollock Dining Room and get blackberry ice cream after hiking. The blackberry ice cream pie is really good and absolutely worth getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/blackberrypie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blackberry Pie at Pollock Dining Room in Shenandoah NP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-climb-hawksbill-mountain&quot;&gt;4. Climb Hawksbill Mountain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hike is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/hawksbill-summit&quot;&gt;1.6 miles and 660 feet of elevation&lt;/a&gt;. If this is too much, there is a nearby mountain called Bearfence Mountain that is a bit easier. This mountain also has a really great view. Shenandoah is one of the only parks I have been to where the pictures you take at summits look cooler than they felt at the moment (it’s generally the other way around).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/hawksbillsummit.png&quot; alt=&quot;View from the top of Hawksbill Mountain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-picnic-lunch-at-lewis-mountain-picnic-area&quot;&gt;5. Picnic Lunch at Lewis Mountain Picnic Area&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought sandwiches and ate them while driving down Skyline drive. We chose the Lewis Mountain Picnic area which was pretty nice, though all the campsites looked nice for lunch and I don’t think this is an important choice. They had a water fountain carved into a rock! (unfortunately not working)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/rockwaterfountain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Water Fountain Carved out of a Rock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-crozet-blue-ridge-tunnel&quot;&gt;6. Crozet Blue Ridge Tunnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Ridge Tunnel is my personal highlight of the visit. I am very surprised it exists and I think it should be more well known. It is an approximately 1 mile long railroad tunnel built in the 1850s. It was abandoned at some point, and is now a multiuse trail for biking/walking. The entrance is not inside Shenandoah National Park, but it does run under the park. It is a 2-mile walk one way. The best way to do it is to have one person drop you off at the West End Parking lot, have them drive over to the East Parking lot, and meet up somewhere in the middle of the tunnel so nobody has to go back and forth through the tunnel. It takes about 25 minutes to walk through the tunnel, and it is pitch black inside. You need flashlights (fully charged phones worked for us). It is very creepy and damp and drippy, though the temperature is nice when it is hot. I felt pretty weird after doing it, but it is one of the most unique hikes I have ever done. Here is a photo of fog abruptly starting at the entrance to the tunnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../images/foghanging.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fog Hanging in front of the tunnel entrance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-itinerary-discussion&quot;&gt;Final Itinerary Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I am pretty proud of this itinerary. There is a variety of things (cool views, good hiking, good food, weird creepy tunnel), and you get to see a large sample of what there is to see at Shenandoah in one day. The other itineraries I saw either suggested spending the whole day on the Old Rag hike, or suggested driving the entire length of the park with very few stops. I hope this itinerary is interesting to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnote: One pet peeve that I want to mention is that the US National Park Service has a section on the website for each park to help you select hikes/walks. This seems like a useful tool, but the hike selection is almost always bad. I assume that it is a technique to guide tourists onto less popular trails to “load balance” the park. I don’t think you should use it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
## Advice on planning trips to US National Parks

This is the 4th or 5th trip to a US National Park that I have been in charge of planing. If you use the right resources, you can put together a pretty good itinerary in a couple hours. A lot of the touristy parks in the US are driving oriented, and have very simple road structures (a loop, 2 loops, a straight line, etc.) that pass through all of the main attractions at the park. It shouldn&apos;t be that hard to choose a path through the road network that hits all the famous stuff at the park (generally marked on a map). Next, AllTrails is good for finding good hikes/walks, and sample itineraries on the internet might teach you about some other attractions. Most parks have a canonical list of famous stuff to see --&gt;

&lt;!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:


&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Tom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &apos;Hi, Tom&apos; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
